# Regression-using-tensorflow

In this notebook we wil go through what is basic regression and how to convert numpy arrays to tensors, tweak the shape which are incompatible.
we will even go through different preprocessing techniques which fastens gradient descent (details about them is clearly written in the notebook )at the end but in the beginning we will try building few sequential models which will perform a basic task of adding two numbers once a model performs well then we will pickup a health insurance dataset from kaggle, preprocess it and train it over the well performed model above.
Thats it from this notebook, we will meet in next notebook covering classification and various techiniques , models to predict them.
